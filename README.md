# Systematizing DeFi Derivatives Protocols

This repository accompanies the paper:

**"Systematizing DeFi Derivatives Protocols: A Comparative Analysis and Conceptual Framework"**  
Authors: Luca Pennella, Pietro Saggese, Fabio Pinelli, Letterio Galletta

## Overview

The repository contains simulations of derivative contract dynamics in DeFi, as described in the paper. It focuses on:
- Perpetual Futures
- Everlasting Options
- Synthetic Assets

Simulations are based on Monte Carlo paths and track:
- Position equity
- PnL (profit and loss)
- Liquidation events
- Funding costs and protocol fees

## Structure

- `notebooks/Perpetuals_Sim.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing simulations for perpetual contracts.
- `figures/`: Outputs and plots from the simulations.
